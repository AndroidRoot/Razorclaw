Razorclaw - asus backup local root exploit
by android.mobi
==========================================

Razorclaw is a root exploit in the asus backup functionality introduced
in the recent firmware updates.

Razorclaw (both the java and native components) are licensed under the 
GNU GPL v2. sqlite3 is released under the public domain.

Building the java application
-----------------------------

    Build using eclipse or ant:-
        
        $ ant debug 

           -or-
        
        $ ant release

Building the native binary
--------------------------

    Please note that the native binary (assets/razorclaw) is not rebuilt
    by default, to rebuild it please run:-

        $ make -C assets/

    You will need arm-eabi-gcc in your path from the android source tree
    and not the NDK.

    The source for the native binary can be found in the native/ directory.
