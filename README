Razorclaw - asus backup local root exploit
by android.mobi
==========================================

Razorclaw is a root exploit in the asus backup functionality introduced
in the recent firmware updates.

Building the java application
-----------------------------

    Build using eclipse or ant:-
        
        $ ant debug 

           -or-
        
        $ ant release

Building the native binary
--------------------------

    Please note that the native binary (assets/razorclaw) is not rebuilt
    by default, to rebuild it please run:-

        $ make -C assets/

    You will need arm-eabi-gcc in your path from the android source tree
    and not the NDK.

    The source for the native binary can be found in the native/ directory.
